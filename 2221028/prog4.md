## Program 4 : Write a program to display operators in C.
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a=69, b=96;
printf("A = %d\n B = %d\n\n",a,b);
printf("A + B = %d (Addition operator)\n",a+b);
printf("A - B = %d (Subtraction operator)\n",a-b);
printf("A * B = %d (Multiplication operator)\n",a*b);
printf("A / B = %d (Division operator)\n",a/b);
printf("A  mod B = %d (Remainder operator)\n",a%b);
return 0;
}
```
```
Output : A = 69
 B = 96
A + B = 165 (Addition operator)
A - B = -27 (Subtraction operator)
A * B = 6624 (Multiplication operator)
A / B = 0 (Division operator)
A  mod B = 69 (Remainder operator)
```
